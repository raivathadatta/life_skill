## Habits I would like to change or do less :
  There are two habits that I would like to change: my eating habits and my phone usage. I want to eat healthier food, so I will reward or punish myself based on what I consume.
  And for my mobile phone usage, I am planning to allocate specific times for usage and change the position or screen settings to make it less comfortable to use

## The habit I would like to do more :
     like to cook food myself and read more. So, when I have food cravings, I start cooking. For reading,
     I calculate how much time I need to spend on my phone, and I consider why I am interested in that content. I read books or articles on those topics.

##  Most interesting Idea :
     Celebrating the victory for small successes or completing small tasks is essential to achieving your goals. There needs to be a behavioural change, and it is not tough; it takes time to change the environment you choose to live in. To reach your goal, habits need to be changed daily. For example, if I want to start writing, then I need to change the habit of writing simply and learn how to write.
     Writing  grocery lists, daily to-do lists, sending messages, and many more small habit changes help to grow.

 B - MAP to make making new habits easier:
 B - behaviour, M-motivation 
 A - ability, p-prompt 


To form a new habit, split it into smaller habits. For example, if I want to lose weight or read books, reading a book is a new habit.
Starting it for me is a very hard start, so I keep a book visible at all times, just like my phone. I start reading the book only when my motivation matches my ability to read. Therefore, I start by 
reading at least a page, not for 15 or 20 minutes, but just a single page without any time constraints. I read a paragraph or 
even just a line to initiate the new behaviour and gradually increase the pace of the habit from one line to two. If I have time or I'm motivated enough,
I read more.



## The most interesting story or idea from 1% better every day :
To form a habit, make it easy to access and the habit to stop or do less, make it difficult to reach. For example, if I want to eat Manchurian, ordering food from Zomato is easy. However, if I am interested in stopping eating outside, 
I will make the Manchurian balls, prepare the sauce, and cook them myself. If it takes a lot of time to make it, it helps to reduce my craving for food.

## Atomic habits book's perspective on Identity :
There should be a change in behaviour. The motivation that comes from within  helps to  change the habit to behaviour. When a goal is set, it helps to motivate from outside. This motivation does not last for a longer time; 
it may stay only until one reaches the goal. If it is from within, it helps to sustain continuous effort and makes it a behaviour.

## How to make habit easy ?? 
start the habit next or before a regular behaviour For example  I want to read a book and the book is the cupboard. I will not recognise it until I remember it.
because it is inside and not easily accessible, so keeping the book beside a bed or near to daily routine or a place where I often keep my phone, helps me to recognise the book and 
reminds me to read it  and I start reading it eventually.
