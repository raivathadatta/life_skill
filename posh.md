## Behaviour cause sexual harassment:
Speaking on the sexual lives of coworkers,
Making sexual jokes,
Repeated complement of other appearances,

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
For the first time I warn the person and if it repeats then complain against the person about their behaviour
