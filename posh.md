## Behaviour cause sexual harassment:
speaking on the sexual lives of coworkers,
making sexual jokes,
repeated complement of other appearances,

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
for the first time I warn the person and if it repeats then complain against the person about their behaviour
