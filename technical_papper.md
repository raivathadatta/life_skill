and it is tough to add new elements for spefic users only or to add any data in futher, for example what kind of data needs to be saved is predefined for the user [name,id,number,address] these can be added but for some users if there is another info need to be added then there no scope mainly to replace these kind of situations no SQL  came #why NoSql?? in the above case, with the help of NoSQL type database we can store any info,if an image is added or new address need to be added to only a spefic user, not for remaining users it could not be done in sql #Types ##Document type these type of data bases store data in form of Document JSON, XML, or BSON formats.

 ##Key-Value Stores:
 hear data is stored in  key-value pair, where each key is unique and associated with a value. 
 These databases are highly scalable and efficient for simple retrieval operations. 
 Examples  Amazon DynamoDB https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/
 
 ##Column-Family Stores: 
 hear the data is stored in long column as key value key in row 1 and values in 2 ,these are more sutable for 
 analyzing and processing
 Example  Apache Cassandra https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html
 
 ##Graph Databases 
 the data is stored in nodes format.this kind of db is mostly used for mapping and quaring data with complex relations
